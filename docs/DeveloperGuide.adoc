== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EateryListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an `Eatery`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Eatery>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store all the Tag objects in a static Tag HashMap which resides in the Tag class. An Eatery can reference a Tag object from the static Tag HashMap. This would allow EatMe to only require one Tag object per unique Tag, instead of each Eatery needing their own Tag object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add[]
=== Add Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasEatery()` -- Checks if an Eatery with the same identity as Eatery e exists in the address book.
* `AddressBook#addEatery()` -- Adds an Eatery to the address book. The eatery must not already exist in the address book.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasEatery()` and `Model#addEatery()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `add \n Two Chefs Eating Place \a 116 Commonwealth Cres, #01-129 \c Chinese` to add a new eatery. The `add` command will call `Model#addEatery()`.

[NOTE]
If the command is missing a `Name`, `Address`, or `Category` parameter, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to add the Eatery.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:
image:add-sd.PNG[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::add-ad.PNG[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Add executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Making Tag field not final.
** Pros:
*** Easily implemented.
*** More user-friendly as users would most likely want to delete or add new tags.
** Cons: Does not follow the logic of the original Address Book 3 application. More code needs to be refactored.

* **Alternative 2:** Making Tag field final.
** Pros: Follows the logic of the original Address Book 3 application; don't need to refactor more code.
** Cons: Not as user-friendly.
// end ::add[]

// tag::revieweatery[]
=== [Proposed] Review Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The review mechanism is facilitated by the existing `AddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with a review field, stored internally as an array list of reviews along with other
attributes of an eatery.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#review()` -- Adds a review to the eatery identified by the user input.
* `AddressBook#editReview()` -- Edits a previously written review.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `review 1 ...` command to add a review to the first Eatery in the address book. The `review` command will call `Eatery#addReview()`.
[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to review the Eatery.

Step 3. The user executes `open 1` to get the complete details of the first Eatery.

Step 4. The user then decides to execute `edit review 1 ...` to edit the first review of the Eatery opened in the previous step. This calls the `EatMe#editcommand()`.

===== Aspect: How review and edit review executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** No further nesting of Review field in Eatery.
** Pros: Easily implemented.
** Cons: May be worse OOP model as compared to other commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Further nesting of Review field in Eatery.
** Pros: A better OOP model.
** Cons: May decrease performance and difficult to implement.

* **Current choice:** Store and edit the reviews of an eatery in a list.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: List is not immutable.
// end::revieweatery[]

// tag::close[]
=== Close Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The close mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements ReadOnlyAddressBook interface with the following operation:

* `AddressBook#setEatery()` -- Replaces an Eatery with a modified Eatery specified by the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the close mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `close 1` command to close the 1st Eatery in the address book.
[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

Step 3. The address book now returns a success message upon successfully closing the Eatery, and the Eatery will be greyed out [proposed].

Step 4. The user then decides that he wants to close another Eatery.
[NOTE]
If the index given points to an Eatery already closed (ie, 1 in this situation), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `close` command works:
image::CloseSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `close` command:
image::CloseCommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Close executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Returns a new Eatery with identical fields except for the isOpen field.
** Pros:
*** Follows pre-exisiting EditCommand implementation.
*** No need for setter methods.
** Cons: Have to return a new object each time a change is made.
* **Alternative 2:** Setter method for isOpen field of Eatery.
** Pros: No need for extra methods in the flow to change the object.
** Cons:
*** Breaks pre-existing EditCommand implementation.
*** Need for setter methods.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the Close command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a boolean value to keep track if the Eatery is reopened or closed.
** Pros: Easily implemented.
** Cons: An additional variable to check when executing other commands. Possibility of incorrect manipulation of an Eatery object
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain two separate lists of Eateries for Reopened and Closed.
** Pros: Closed Eateries stored apart from Reopened Eateries. Commands executed will only affect Eateries stored in a particular list.
** Cons: Requires proper handling of individual data structures to ensure each list is maintained and updated correctly.
// end::close[]

// tag::modeCommand[]
=== Mode Command feature
==== Implementation
Allows the user to toggle between Main mode and Todo mode. It extends 'Command', and once mode had been switched, will affect all other command functions.
The mode is determined through the value of a boolean variable named 'isMainMode'.

Given below is an example usage of how the Mode Command behaved.

Step 1: The user launches the application. Data from `addressbook` will be fetched and will be initialised as `Main Mode` by default.

Step 2: The user execute `mode` command and the mode of the application will be switched to `todo` mode, displaying items in the `todo` list instead.

Step 3: The user can execute `mode` command again, returning the application to `main` mode, showing the items stored in the `main` list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `mode` command works:
image::ModeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::ModeCommandActivity.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Mode execute
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Toggle between mode through a boolean value.
** Pros: Easy for implementation.
** Cons: An additional factor to check when executing any other commands; Possibility of mis-manipulation of data.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support Mode Command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain 2 separate lists for Main mode and Todo Mode.
** Pros: Data between the 2 modes will be separated apart. Commands executed will only affect data stored in the list for the particular mode.
** Cons: More effort required for maintenance purposes. Need to make sure that data from main list should not go into todo list, and vice versa
//end::modeCommand[]

//tag::saveTodoCommand[]
=== SaveTodo Command feature
==== Implementation
This command allows the user to save an eatery from the todo list to the main eatery list. It extends 'Command'.

Given below is an example usage of how the SaveTodo Command behaved.

Step 1: The user launches the application. Data from `addressbook` will be fetched and will be initialised as `Main Mode` by default.

Step 2: The user execute `mode` command and the mode of the application will be switched to `todo` mode, displaying items in the `todo` list instead.

Step 3: The user can execute `save 1`, indicating to the system the index of eatery to be saved.

Step 4: The eatery in the todo list will be removed and an add command will be constructed in the `CommandBox` for user to input any necessary fields before adding.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `SaveTodo` command works:
image::ModeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::ModeCommandActivity.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Mode execute
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Construct the commands as a string before displaying to the user.
** Pros: User-friendly. User will be able to add the eatery to the main list with minimum effort.
** Cons: Unable to save directly to the main list from todo list. Possible situation can be that the user did not `add` the new eatery after executing `saveTodo` command.
This situation will result in the user requiring to type the whole `add` command on his own as information will not be saved.

* **Alternative 2** Allow eatery to have the same attributes fields as eatery in main list
** Pros: As eatery in todo list and main list have the same attributes, it will be possible to `save` the eatery directly to the main list without further input from the user.
** Cons: User will be required to include additional field when `adding` an eatery in the todo list. Field entered may be irrelevant as user had yet to visit the eatery.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support SaveTodo Command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** No additional data structure is required for `SaveTodo` command

//end::saveTodoCommand[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by EatMe
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
