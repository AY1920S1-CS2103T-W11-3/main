== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EateryListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an `Eatery`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Eatery>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store all the Tag objects in a static Tag HashMap which resides in the Tag class. An Eatery can reference a Tag object from the static Tag HashMap. This would allow EatMe to only require one Tag object per unique Tag, instead of each Eatery needing their own Tag object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add[]
=== Add Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasEatery()` -- Checks if an Eatery with the same identity as Eatery e exists in the address book.
* `AddressBook#addEatery()` -- Adds an Eatery to the address book. The eatery must not already exist in the address book.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasEatery()` and `Model#addEatery()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `add \n Two Chefs Eating Place \a 116 Commonwealth Cres, #01-129 \c Chinese` to add a new eatery. The `add` command will call `Model#addEatery()`.

[NOTE]
If the command is missing a `Name`, `Address`, or `Category` parameter, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to add the Eatery.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:
image:add-sd.PNG[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::add-ad.PNG[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Add executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Making Tag field not final.
** Pros:
*** Easily implemented.
*** More user-friendly as users would most likely want to delete or add new tags.
** Cons: Does not follow the logic of the original Address Book 3 application. More code needs to be refactored.

* **Alternative 2:** Making Tag field final.
** Pros: Follows the logic of the original Address Book 3 application; don't need to refactor more code.
** Cons: Not as user-friendly.
// end ::add[]

// tag::revieweatery[]
=== Review Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The review mechanism is facilitated by `EateryList`.
It is stored internally as a set of reviews along with the other
attributes of an eatery.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Eatery#addReview` -- Adds a review to the eatery identified by the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `EateryList` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `review 1 ...` command to add a review to the first Eatery in the address book. The `review` command will call `Eatery#addReview()`.
[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to review the Eatery.

[NOTE]
If the review is missing a `Description`, `Rating`, `Cost` or a `Date` field, an error will be shown to the user instead of adding the review.

Step 3. The address book now returns a success message upon successfully adding a review to the eatery.

[NOTE]
If an eatery is `closed`, the user will be shown an error message saying that the eatery is closed.


===== Aspect: How review executes

* ** Alternative 1 (current choice) **
Adds a review to an eatery's list of reviews.
Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
Cons: The set of reviews of an `Eatery` is not final, unlike tags.

* ** Alternative 2**
Return a new set of reviews every time a review is added.
Pros: Makes the set of reviews final, adhering to the existing model.
Cons: Highly inefficient

===== Aspect: Data Structure used to store Reviews

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
No further nesting of Review field in Eatery.
** Pros: Easily implemented and will not compromise speed.
** Cons: The OOP model might be different from other Commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Further nesting of Review field in Eatery.
** Pros: A better OOP model.
** Cons: May decrease performance and difficult to implement.


// end::revieweatery[]

// tag::editreview[]

=== Edit Review feature
==== Implementation

The edit review mechanism is facilitated by `EateryList`. It makes use of the following operations:

* `EateryList#getActiveEatery`
* `EateryList#getActiveReviews`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the close mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user decides to check the reviews of an eatery by using `show` command.

Step 2. The user then decides to edit the first review of the eatery and executes `editreview 1 ...` with the necessary fields.

[NOTE]
If none of the fields entered are different from the existing fields, the user will be shown an error saying that at least one field should be different.

[NOTE]
If the user input is not according to the given format, an error will be shown to the user instead of attempting to edit the review.

Step 3. The application returns a success message upon successfully editing the review.

==== Design Considerations:

===== Aspect: How edit review executes
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice)**:
When the show command is used, `EateryList#setActiveEatery` will set the eatery shown as the active eatery.
When the user attempts to edit review, the eatery is accessed using `EateryList#getActiveEatery`. The reviews are modified by using
`EateryList#getActiveReviews`, which returns a list of reviews. The changed list is set to the `ActiveEatery`
by `Eatery#setReviews`.

** Pros: Easy to access and edit reviews.
** Cons: The `ActiveEatery` is not modified until the `show` command is used on another eatery.

* ** Alternative 2**:
Operate directly on the list of reviews after using `show` command and set the changed list to the eatery.

** Pros: `EditReview` is only accessible after using `show` command.
** Cons: Difficult to implement and understand.
// end::editreview[]

//tag::deletereview[]
=== Delete Review feature
==== Implementation

The delete review mechanism is facilitated by `EateryList`. It makes use of the following operations:

* `EateryList#getActiveEatery`
* `EateryList#getActiveReviews`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the close mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user decides to check the reviews of an eatery by using `show` command.

Step 2. The user then decides to delete the first review of the eatery and executes `deletereview 1 ...` .

[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

Step 3. The application returns a success message upon successfully deleting the review.

==== Design Considerations:

===== Aspect: How delete review executes
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice)**:
When the show command is used, `EateryList#setActiveEatery` will set the eatery shown as the active eatery.
When the user attempts to delete a review, the eatery is accessed using `EateryList#getActiveEatery`. The reviews are modified by using
`EateryList#getActiveReviews`, which returns a list of reviews. The changed list is set to the `ActiveEatery`
by `Eatery#setReviews`.

** Pros: Easy to access and delete reviews.
** Cons: The `ActiveEatery` is not modified until the `show` command is used on another eatery.

* ** Alternative 2**:
Operate directly on the list of reviews after using `show` command and set the changed list to the eatery.

** Pros: `DeleteReview` is only accessible after using `show` command.
** Cons: Difficult to implement and understand.

//end::deletereview[]

//tag::addtag[]
=== Add Tag feature
==== Implementation
The addtag mechanism is facilitated by the EateryList and implement the following operations:

* `EateryList#getFilteredEateryList`
* `EateryList#setEatery`

The effects of add tag are cumulative, ie it does not replace existing tags but adds the given tags.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addtag mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application and wants to add tags to the first eatery displayed.

Step 2. The user executes `addtag 1 ...` to add the required tags to the eatery.

[NOTE]
If the index specified is invalid (negative or out of bounds) or the format of the command is wrong,
an error will be shown to the user.

Step 3. If the tags to be added are not associated with eatery previously, they will be added to the eatery.

Step 4. AddTag success message is shown to the user.

==== Design Considerations:
===== How AddTag executes:
* ** Current choice: **
Returns a new Eatery object with the existing and new tags. The tags to be added are checked
if they are already associated with the eatery before adding.

** Pros:
Preserves the OOP model of the project and there is no need for setter methods.

** Cons: Very inefficient to return new Eatery object every time tags are changed.

//end::addtag[]

//tag:: deletetag[]
=== Delete Tag feature

==== Implementation
The deleteTag mechanism is facilitated by the EateryList and implement the following operations:

* `EateryList#getFilteredEateryList`
* `EateryList#setEatery`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addtag mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application and wants to delete tags from the first eatery displayed.

Step 2. The user executes `deletetag 1 ...` to delete the required tags from the eatery.

[NOTE]
If the index specified is invalid (negative or out of bounds) or the format of the command is wrong,
an error will be shown to the user.

Step 3. If the tags to be deleted are not associated with eatery previously, no changes will be made.

Step 4. DeleteTag success message is shown to the user.

==== Design Considerations:
===== How AddTag executes:
* ** Current choice: **
Returns a new Eatery object with the existing and new tags. The tags to be deleted are checked
if they are already associated with the eatery before deleting.

** Pros:
Preserves the OOP model of the project and there is no need for setter methods.

** Cons: Very inefficient to return new Eatery object every time tags are changed.


//end::deletetag[]

// tag::close[]
=== Close Eatery feature
==== Implementation

The close mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` interface with the following operation:

* `AddressBook#setEatery()` -- Replaces an Eatery with a modified Eatery specified by the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the close mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `close 1` command to close the 1st Eatery in the address book.
[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

Step 3. The address book now returns a success message upon successfully closing the Eatery, and the Eatery will be greyed out [proposed].

Step 4. The user then decides that he wants to close another Eatery.
[NOTE]
If the index given points to an Eatery already closed (ie, 1 in this situation), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `close` command works:
image::CloseSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `close` command:
image::CloseCommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Close executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Returns a new Eatery with identical fields except for the isOpen field.
** Pros:
*** Follows pre-exisiting EditCommand implementation.
*** No need for setter methods.
** Cons: Have to return a new object each time a change is made.
* **Alternative 2:** Setter method for isOpen field of Eatery.
** Pros: No need for extra methods in the flow to change the object.
** Cons:
*** Breaks pre-existing EditCommand implementation.
*** Need for setter methods.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the Close command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a boolean value to keep track if the Eatery is reopened or closed.
** Pros: Easily implemented.
** Cons: An additional variable to check when executing other commands. Possibility of incorrect manipulation of an Eatery object
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain two separate lists of Eateries for Reopened and Closed.
** Pros: Closed Eateries stored apart from Reopened Eateries. Commands executed will only affect Eateries stored in a particular list.
** Cons: Requires proper handling of individual data structures to ensure each list is maintained and updated correctly.
// end::close[]

// tag::modeCommand[]
=== [Proposed] Mode Command feature
==== Implementation
Allows the user to toggle between Main mode and Todo mode. It extends `Command`, and once the mode has been switched, it will affect all other command functions.
The mode is determined through the `isMainMode` boolean variable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mode mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be will be initialised as the *Main Mode* with the initial json data stored.

Step 2: The user executes `mode` command to switch EatMe to the *Todo Mode* which displays `Eateries` in the *Todo* list.

Step 3: The user can execute `mode` command again to switch EatMe back to the *Main Mode* which displays the `Eateries` in the *Main* list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `mode` command works:
image::ModeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `mode` command:
image::ModeCommandActivity.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Mode executes
* **Current choice:** Toggles between mode through a boolean value.
** Pros: Easily implemented.
** Cons: An additional variable to check when executing other commands. Possibility of incorrect manipulation of an Eatery object.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support Mode Command
* **Current choice:** Maintains two separate lists of Eateries for Main mode and Todo Mode.
** Pros: Todo Eateries stored apart from Main Eateries. Commands executed will only affect Eateries stored in a particular list.
** Cons: Requires proper handling of individual data structures to ensure each list is maintained and updated correctly.
//end::modeCommand[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by EatMe
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
