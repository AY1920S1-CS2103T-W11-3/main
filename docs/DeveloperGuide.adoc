== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::close[]
=== Close feature
==== Implementation

The close mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements ReadOnlyAddressBook with a AddressBook#setEatery() method.
This method of replacing an Eatery with a modified Eatery (isOpen field set to false) is similar to the edit mechanism of EditCommand.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the close mechanism behaves at each step.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial Json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `close `1 command to close the 1st Eatery in the address book.
[NOTE]
If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

Step 3. The address book now returns a success message upon successfully closing the Eatery, and the Eatery will be greyed out [proposed].

Step 4. The user now decides that he wants to close another Eatery.
[NOTE]
If the index given points to an Eatery already closed (Ie, 1 in this situation), it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to close the Eatery.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::CloseSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new CloseCommand:

image::CloseCommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How close executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Returns a new Eatery with the same fields except the isOpen field.
** Pros:
*** Follows pre-exisitng EditCommand implementation.
*** No need for setter methods.
** Cons: Have to return a new object each time a change is made.
* **Alternative 2:** Setter method for isOpen field of Eatery.
** Pros: No need for extra methods in the flow to change the object.
** Cons:
*** Breaks pre-existing EditCommand implementation.
*** Need for setter methods.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the close commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a boolean isOpen field for an Eatery Object to keep track if the Eatery is open or closed.
** Pros:
*** Only one saved Json file needed.
*** Eatery ID easily implemented.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain two lists of Eateries, one for open, another for close.
** Pros: Closed Eateries kept separate from Open Eateries
** Cons: Requires proper handling of individual data structures to ensure each list is maintained and updated correctly.
// end::close[]

// tag::modeCommand[]
=== [Proposed] Mode Command feature
==== Proposed Implementation
Allows the user to toggle between Main mode and Todo mode. It extends 'Command', and once mode had been switched, will affect all other command functions.
The mode is determined through the value of a boolean variable named 'isMainMode'.

Given below is an example usage of how the Mode Command behaved.

Step 1: The user launches the application. Data from `addressbook` will be fetched and will be initialised as `Main Mode` by default.

Step 2: The user execute `mode` command and the mode of the application will be switched to `todo` mode, displaying items in the `todo` list instead.

Step 3: The user can execute `mode` command again, returning the application to `main` mode, showing the items stored in the `main` list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `mode` command works:
image::ModeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::ModeCommandActivity.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Mode execute
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Toggle between mode through a boolean value.
** Pros: Easy for implementation.
** Cons: An additional factor to check when executing any other commands; Possibility of mis-manipulation of data.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support Mode Command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain 2 separate lists for Main mode and Todo Mode.
** Pros: Data between the 2 modes will be separated apart. Commands executed will only affect data stored in the list for the particular mode.
** Cons: More effort required for maintenance purposes. Need to make sure that data from main list should not go into todo list, and vice versa

//end::modeCommand[]

// tag::add[]
=== Add eatery feature
==== Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasEatery(Eatery e)` -- Checks if an Eatery with the same identity as Eatery e exists in the address book.
* `AddressBook#addEatery(Eatery e)` -- Adds an Eatery to the address book. The eatery must not already exist in the address book.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasEatery()` and `Model#addEatery()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add eatery mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the default eateries.

Step 2. The user executes `add \n Two Chefs Eating Place \a 116 Commonwealth Cres, #01-129 \c Chinese` to add a new eatery. The `add` command also calls `Model#addEatery(Eatery e)`.

[NOTE]
If the command is missing a `Name`, `Address`, or `Category` parameter, the execution of the add command will fail and the application will throw a `ParseException`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:
image:add-sd.PNG[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
image::add-ad.PNG[]
// end ::add[]

// tag::revieweatery[]
=== [Proposed] Review eatery

The review mechanism is facilitated by the existing `AddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with a review field, stored internally as an array list of reviews along with other
attributes of an eatery.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#review()` -- Adds a review to the eatery identified by the user  input.
* `AddressBook#editReview()` -- Edits a previously written review.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user adds an eatery to through an `add command`.

Step 2. The user executes `review 1 ...` command to add a review to the 1st eatery in the address book. The `review` command calls `Eatery#addReview()`, causing the application to add a review field correspondingly to the specified eatery.

Step 3. The user executes `open 1` to get the complete details of the 1st eatery.

Ste] 4. The user now decides to execute `edit review 1 ...` to edit the 1st review of the eatery shown on using the `open 1` command in the previous step. This calls the `EatMe#editcommand()`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How review and edit review execute

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Review field under eatery is not nested further. It adds and modifies review of eateries without created new eatery objects as in the case of edit command.
** Pros: Easy to implement and is faster.
** Cons: May have less OOP structure as compared to other commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Review field is nested further and each addition of review or edit to a review creates a new eatery object with all the reviews.
** Pros: Is structured in a more OOP manner.
** Cons: May decrease performance and difficult to implement.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store and edit the reviews of an eatery.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: List is not immutable.


// end::revieweatery[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
